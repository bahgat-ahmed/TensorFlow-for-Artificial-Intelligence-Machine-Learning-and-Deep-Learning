# TensorFlow-for-Artificial-Intelligence-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning

I was taking this course [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow) on Coursera, and this is the first course in the [TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) Specialization on Coursera provided by deeplearning.ai. Here are the Notebooks I practiced in while taking this course. These Notebooks are initially formed by the course providers **deeplearning.ai**.
